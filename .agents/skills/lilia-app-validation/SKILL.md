# Lilia App Validation

## Choose The Smallest Meaningful Check

Run checks that validate real behavior affected by the change. Prefer targeted functional checks over broad or brittle assertions.

- Always consider `yarn agent:debug --json` when app boundaries, important files, or recommended checks may have changed.
- Use `$lilia-agent-debug` to choose checks for UI main paths, `data-agent-id`, debug harnesses, and desktop replay support.
- Use `yarn test` for route behavior, command wiring, component behavior, config synchronization expectations, and business logic.
- Use `yarn build` for frontend compile, bundling, route import, and type integration risk.
- Use `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` for app-owned Rust changes.
- Use `yarn verify` for broader final confidence when the change crosses frontend, Tauri, config, or build boundaries.

## Test Quality

- Add tests only for behavior changes or meaningful regression risk.
- Do not add tests for documentation-only, comment-only, or formatting-only changes.
- Do not write low-value tests that only hard-match log text, incidental strings, implementation comments, or snapshot-like markup.
- Do not use raw string matching as the main assertion when it does not prove the feature works; assert the behavior through roles, events, state changes, command effects, data results, or observable outcomes.
- Test user-visible behavior, command results, route outcomes, config synchronization, permission availability, or data-contract handling.
- For Agent debug changes, follow `$lilia-agent-debug` test-quality and gating requirements.
- Keep tests focused on the changed capability and existing public behavior.

## LiliaUI Dependency Changes

When changing the local LiliaUI dependency switch, package scripts, or documentation:

- Treat the switch itself as the behavior under test. Do not add low-value tests that hard-match script output.
- Run `node --check scripts/lilia-ui-deps.mjs` after editing the switch script.
- Run `yarn liliaui:local`, confirm every active `@lilia/*` package reports a local `portal:` source, then run `yarn liliaui:remote` and confirm `yarn liliaui:status` reports remote again.
- Confirm `package.json` and `yarn.lock` do not retain local `resolutions` or `portal:` entries after switching back.
- Run `yarn install --immutable` to prove the committed default dependency state still uses the pinned GitHub lockfile.
- Skip broader desktop or Agent validation unless the change also affects app runtime behavior, build wrappers, UI, commands, or the Agent debug harness.

When a final app consumes a changed LiliaUI package:

- Validate LiliaUI in its source repository first: use `yarn typecheck` and `yarn test` for package or UI changes.
- For `tauri-plugin-lilia`, run `cargo test -p tauri-plugin-lilia` in LiliaUI.
- After refreshing the final app dependency or lockfile, run at least `yarn agent:debug --json`, `yarn test`, and any affected build or Tauri check.
- For preset work, verify Lilia and Nana against both remote and local sources. Each combination must pass tests, production bundle guard, and Tauri no-bundle compilation; Nana additionally runs browser workflows.

## Reporting

- State exactly which checks ran and whether they passed.
- If a check was skipped, explain why it was not necessary for the change.
- If a check cannot run, include the blocking error and remaining risk.
- Do not treat unrelated full-suite failures as blockers without confirming they touch the edited surface.
