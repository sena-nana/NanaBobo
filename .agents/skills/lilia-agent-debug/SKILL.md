Use when adding, changing, validating, or reviewing Agent debug support, data-agent-id targets, window.__liliaAgentDebug, yarn agent:debug, tauri-driver readiness, debug-only UI instrumentation, or desktop replay/debug harness behavior.

# Lilia Agent Debug

## Core Rule

Treat Agent debugging as a real developer interface, not as visible product UI. Users should see normal application state; Agents should get stable hidden structure and dev-only debug APIs.

## Ownership

- Put shared frontend harness code in `@lilia/ui`.
- Put readiness reports, target checks, template checks, and migrations in `@lilia/tools`.
- Put desktop replay orchestration, dev-server startup, `tauri-driver`, screenshots, and artifact collection in `@lilia/build`.
- Keep final app code limited to app-owned `data-agent-id` targets, feature-specific scenarios, and thin script entries.
- Do not copy Lilia app provider protocols, chat timelines, runner commands, or private scenario scripts into the template unless the final app truly implements that behavior.

## Implementation Pattern

1. Start with `$lilia-app-boundary` when the change crosses template, LiliaUI, Tauri, or app-owned feature code.
2. Keep files small and single-purpose. Split harness work into env, types, logging, snapshots, actions, and installer modules when the logic grows.
3. Gate frontend debug APIs with explicit dev/test flags such as `VITE_LILIA_AGENT_DEBUG=1` or an agent-debug mode. Debug APIs must not install in normal production UI.
4. Expose stable `data-agent-id` values for primary controls, important rows, retry/recover actions, filters, tabs, dialogs, and destructive confirmations.
5. Name `data-agent-id` by functional path, not translated text, CSS class, DOM position, or layout: `home.start-card`, `settings.provider.save`, `tasks.row.<taskId>.open`.
6. Keep `data-agent-id` invisible and non-semantic to users. Do not add public technical instructions, automation labels, or debug-only copy.
7. When adding a template script, prefer a thin entry that delegates to `@lilia/tools` or `@lilia/build`. Compatibility fallbacks should be isolated and removable.

## Expected Interfaces

- `yarn agent:debug --json`: returns readiness, important files, stable targets, relevant environment flags, and external tool availability.
- `window.__liliaAgentDebug.observe()`: returns route, viewport, active element, visible `data-agent-id` tree, and recent errors.
- `window.__liliaAgentDebug.act(...)`: operates by `data-agent-id`, not by text, class, coordinate, or screenshot matching.
- `window.__liliaAgentDebug.mark(...)`: records a debug marker without changing business data.
- `window.__liliaAgentDebug.getRecentErrors()`: exposes recent frontend errors for debugging.

## Desktop Replay

Use `tauri-driver` for desktop automation, but do not model it as an npm dependency.

- Detect `tauri-driver`, EdgeDriver or another WebDriver bridge in readiness reports.
- Treat missing desktop replay tools as a setup blocker only for replay scenarios, not for basic template readiness.
- Write screenshots, logs, replay steps, and summary artifacts when implementing full replay in `@lilia/build`.
- Keep replay scenarios functional: assert route behavior, command effects, stable targets, invoke boundaries, or persisted records. Do not hard-match incidental text or logs.

## Validation

- For harness changes in LiliaUI, run focused UI tests plus the relevant package typecheck.
- For `@lilia/tools` report changes, run focused tools tests and `yarn workspace @lilia/tools typecheck`.
- For template script or target changes, run `yarn agent:debug --json`, `yarn test tests/tooling.test.ts`, and `yarn build` when frontend files changed.
- If a full desktop replay is expected but cannot run, report the missing tool, command, artifact path if any, and remaining risk.
